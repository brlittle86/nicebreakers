        <p>Let's say you find yourself waiting for your coffee at your favorite coffee shop, and suddenly a person approaches you, commenting on your appearance and asking your name. This person is fidgeting and won't look straight at you when they speak. They are standing too close, practically breathing in your face. Does this make you uncomfortable? Would you want to talk to this person?</p>

        <p>Our goal is to provide you with a bit of a primer to avoid situations like the one above! Whether you are hesitant to approach someone, are unsure of what is appropriate to say or do, or simply don't know how to leave a conversation, this training should give you some insight on communication in a variety of social situations and settings.</p>
