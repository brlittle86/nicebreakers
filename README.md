Team members: Stephanie, Brandon, Luay <br>
Project Name: Nice Breakers <br>
Project Concept: Provide an interactive training environment on what would be an appropriate opening line in given scenarios. <br>

Problem Domain: Many people have difficulty engaging in conversation with others. Our site aims to give direction and feedback to people who need more practice with social engagement. We will be building a training activity to act as a conversational skills primer. There will be at least 6 questions that will allow the user to pick a response to a specific scenario. Once the response is submitted, we will give feedback to the user about their choice. We will also be including a resource page with tips and links to external websites.

User Stories:
* As a user, I want to be able to privately build my social engagement skills using an interactive app.
* As a user, I want a website that is easy to use and navigate.
* As a user, I want the page to feel personalized.
* As a user, I don't want to have to search extensively for good resources.
* As a developer, I want to create a website that has 4 different pages with distinguished html and css for each.

Stetch goals:
* As a developer, I want to have information about the additional resources appear on a hover.
* As a developer, I want to have background images associated with each specific scenario.
* As a user, I want to be able to get feedback for engagement with different levels of relationships.
